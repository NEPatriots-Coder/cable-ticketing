**Subject:** Cable Ticketing System - Demo & Implementation Proposal

---

Hi [Team/Stakeholder Name],

I'm excited to share a new **Cable Ticketing System** I've built to streamline our cable request workflow. This eliminates the communication chaos of phone calls and emails with a simple, trackable digital process.

## 📋 What It Does

**Problem:** Currently, cable requests happen via phone/email with no tracking, leading to lost requests, manual follow-ups, and zero visibility.

**Solution:** A web-based ticketing system where:
1. Technicians submit cable requests (30 seconds)
2. Inventory staff receive SMS + Email with one-click approve/reject
3. System tracks everything from creation to fulfillment

## ✨ Key Features

- **Instant Notifications**: SMS via Twilio + Email via SendGrid
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: See all tickets and statistics
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on any device
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history of every request
- **Production-Ready**: Containerized with Docker, deploys to CoreWeave via Kubernetes

## 💰 Cost

- **Development**: $0 (built in-house)
- **Production**: $15-40/month
  - CoreWeave: $10-30 (compute + storage)
  - Twilio: $1 + ~$0.0075 per SMS
  - SendGrid: Free (100 emails/day)

## 🚀 Next Steps

I'd love to show you a **live demo** and discuss implementation:

1. **Demo** (10 min): See the full workflow in action
2. **Discussion** (10 min): Answer questions, gather feedback
3. **Timeline** (5 min): Plan 4-week deployment

**Attached:**
- `Cable_Ticketing_Stakeholder_Presentation.pptx` (14 slides)
- Technical documentation in project folder

## 📅 Schedule

Can we schedule 30 minutes this week for a demo? I have availability:
- [Your available times]

Or I can set up the demo environment and send you login credentials to explore on your own.

**Quick Stats:**
- Full-stack app (React + Flask)
- 14-slide presentation attached
- Complete Docker + Kubernetes deployment
- Ready to deploy to CoreWeave today

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,

## 🎤 Verbal Pitch (If In-Person)

"Hey, I've been working on something to fix our cable request process. Right now it's all phone calls and emails - stuff gets lost, no tracking.

I built a ticketing system: technicians submit requests on a web form, inventory staff get SMS and email with approve/reject links, everything's tracked. Takes 30 seconds to create a ticket.

It's production-ready - Docker containers, Kubernetes, deploys to CoreWeave. Costs about $30/month.

Can I show you a quick demo? Takes 10 minutes."

Good luck with your demo! 🚀
